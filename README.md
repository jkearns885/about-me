# About Me

My name is Julie Kearns. I am currently in a operations project management role with a focus in customer interface systems. I am working toward a certificate in coding to gain more experience on the development side.

My first job out of college was as a customer sales account coordinator for a trading company. I was promoted in 2019 to the team lead on an acquisition for a large manufacturing business. Now, I have been moved up to the production planning team for multiple manufacturing mills across the country.
